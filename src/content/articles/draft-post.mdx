# Draft Post

This is a draft post that is still being written. It should only appear in the development environment, not in production.

## Why Use Draft Mode?

Draft mode allows you to work on posts without publishing them to the world.

- You can experiment with content
- You can share preview links with editors
- You can iterate on your writing

```typescript
// This is some example code
function isProduction() {
  return process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production';
}

const shouldShowDrafts = !isProduction();
```

More content will be added to this post later...
