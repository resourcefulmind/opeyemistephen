# When Payments Own the Base Layer: What Corporate L1s Mean for L2s — and for Africa v2.0

A founder described today as "9/11 for L2s." I don't endorse that phrasing, but I get the sentiment: when **payments companies start owning the base layer**, incentives and gravity change. **Circle** is bringing USDC into the substrate with **Arc**; **Fortune** says **Stripe** is quietly building **Tempo**. This isn't "just another chain." It's a bid to **vertically integrate settlement**, fees, FX, and compliance in one place.

In other words, the companies that move money want to own the road, not just drive on it.

## TL;DR

- Circle just announced **Arc**, a stablecoin-native **Layer-1** (USDC as gas; EVM-compatible) with **private testnet in weeks**, **public testnet this fall**, **mainnet beta in 2026**.
    
    Circle wants USDC to be the engine *and* the fuel.
    
- **Fortune** reports **Stripe is building "Tempo,"** a payments-first L1 with **Paradigm**; it's **stealth** and **Ethereum-compatible**. Not officially confirmed beyond the report and subsequent coverage.
    
    Stripe may move from using blockchains to *running* one.
    
- Today, **Ethereum L2s carry ~10× L1's transaction throughput** by user-ops, with **Base, Arbitrum, and OP** leading; **Arbitrum ~$19.2B TVS, Base ~$15.8B**.
    
    Today's crypto "busy streets" are L2s, not L1s.
    
- **Stablecoins settled >$12T in 2024** and are on track for much more in 2025 — the real prize isn't "users" but **dollar settlement at scale**.
- For Africa: this could **lower remittance and B2B costs** and normalize **USD rails**—but raises **centralization, compliance gating, and dollarization** risks. SSA's average remittance cost is still **~8.37%**; any new rail must beat that.
    
    Faster, cheaper money—if the rules and partners line up.

## The spark (and why I'm writing this)

A founder described today as "9/11 for L2s." I don't endorse that phrasing, but I get the sentiment: when **payments companies start owning the base layer**, incentives and gravity change. **Circle** is bringing USDC into the substrate with **Arc**; **Fortune** says **Stripe** is quietly building **Tempo**. This isn't "just another chain." It's a bid to **vertically integrate settlement**, fees, FX, and compliance in one place.

In other words, the companies that move money want to own the road, not just drive on it.

## Baseline: what L2s actually do today (so we measure impact correctly)

- **Throughput:** Over the last year, **L2 user-ops per second ≈ 10.2× Ethereum L1**. In plain English: most activity by *count* has moved to L2s. **Base** currently tops the board by activity.
- **Capital:** **Arbitrum ≈ $19.18B TVS**, **Base ≈ $15.76B**, **OP Mainnet ≈ $3.89B** (rolling 1-year window).

L2s exist to scale existing L1s: cheaper fees, higher throughput, and a familiar developer toolchain. This is why people are anxious: L2s are where devs ship and where users click—they are express lanes bolted onto a busy highway.

## Why payments firms might go L1 (and not just "use an L2")

**Control and predictability.** If you run the **base layer**, you can:

- **Compress the fee stack** (less paid "up the chain").
- Ship **native stablecoin gas** (Arc: USDC for fees) and **sub-second finality** tuned for merchant UX.
- Bake in **compliance primitives and FX** (KYCable on/off-ramps, programmable rules, fiat pairs).
- Reduce **vendor ambiguity** for enterprises (one throat to choke).

**Stripe's** reported **Tempo** fits the same logic: own the moment of settlement for stablecoin payments instead of renting it. It's cheaper, simpler, and safer (for them) if they run the whole stack. Depending solely on L2s means inheriting upstream fees, governance timelines, and bridge risks. A bespoke L1 reduces those dependencies. If you rent your rails, your landlord sets the rules.

That said, it's **stealth**—we have a **Fortune** report and secondary coverage, not official docs. Treat it as directional, not done.

## Africa lens: what could really change (and what won't)

**Costs and speed.** Sub-Saharan Africa remains the **most expensive region** for remittances: **~8.37%** average to send $200 (Q2 2024). If **Arc** (and possibly **Tempo**) land credible partners in-country and squeeze spreads with **stablecoin-native FX**, corridors like **NG↔UK/EU** or **KE↔GCC** could finally see structural cost drops and near-instant settlement. That's the bar.

You'll see trials first, not instant miracles. If the pipes connect, sending money could get cheaper and quicker.

**Rails we already use.** Stablecoins are **not theoretical** here. Nigeria alone saw **≈$59B** in crypto inflows (Jul 2023–Jun 2024), with **stablecoins** a top use case for remittances, savings, and commerce. Corporate L1s will try to **formalize** what people already do informally.

**Local infrastructure players.** Providers like **Blockradar** (wallet-as-a-service for stablecoins) and **Paycrest** (decentralized liquidity/payments network) are the last-mile glue. If Arc/Tempo become default rails, these players either (a) **abstract and localize** them for banks/fintechs (KYC, payouts, reconciliation), or (b) get **disintermediated** if corporate L1s ship turnkey SDKs plus local bank partnerships. My bet: Africa still needs **local abstractions** to connect to **Naira/KES/mobile-money** reality.

The winning play is being the easy adapter, not another chain.

**Policy direction.** Nigeria has been signaling **openness to regulated stablecoin businesses** under the new **Investment and Securities Act 2025**; Kenya's **VASP Bill (2025)** is progressing in Parliament. Translation: on/off-ramps will tighten and formalize. That's good for enterprise adoption, but it also raises the **compliance bar** for users.

## Scenarios, not predictions (how big could the shift be?)

The target isn't "daily active users" — it's **settlement volume**. Stablecoins **settled >$12T in 2024** across chains; 2025 is tracking higher. If **Arc** (and later **Tempo**) captured even a **single-digit** share of settlement over time, that's **hundreds of billions** annually flowing on corporate L1s — with some of that **migrating from L2s**, some from L1, and some from non-ETH chains. (Cannibalization won't be L2-only.)

A small slice of a huge pie is still enormous—and it won't come only from L2s.

In numbers, here's a conservative scenario using a **$12T** annual stablecoin-settlement baseline (2024).

> Assumption: Global stablecoin settlement ≥ $12T in 2024 (Coin Metrics). This is scenario math, not a prediction.

| Share captured by corporate L1s | Annual flow redirected | Monthly flow redirected | In plain terms |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **5%** | **$600B** | **$50B** | A sliver of a huge pie is still a big rail. |
| **10%** | **$1.2T** | **$100B** | Starts to dent L2/L1 and non-ETH settlement. |
| **20%** | **$2.4T** | **$200B** | Clear structural shift in where value settles. |

**What decides the number?**

- **Who onboards the banks/PSPs/MTOs** in NG, KE, GH, ZA.
- **FX quality** and **fee transparency** (does it actually beat today's ~8% benchmarks?).
- **Exchange listings and market-maker depth** (liquidity follows incentives).
- **Bridges and CCTP-like mechanisms** to move balances in/out safely.

Partners, prices, and liquidity decide winners.

## Dollarization pressure vs domestic units (cNGN, etc.)

**Dollar rails are sticky** because they solve inflation and FX pain. But **cNGN** — a **Naira-pegged stablecoin** from the **Africa Stablecoin Consortium** operating with **CBN oversight via sandbox** — is an attempt to **digitize NGN** and keep commerce in local units where appropriate. It can ease dollar pressure **if** it achieves real acceptance, corridor liquidity, and easy conversion to/from USD stables in compliant venues. Otherwise, users default to USDC/USDT for depth.

**Net-net:** If Arc's FX and partner stack support **cNGN↔USDC** cleanly (and similarly for KES/ZAR-pegs), domestic units could **coexist** with dollar rails instead of being crowded out. That's a design choice, not a given.

Good plumbing lets naira and dollars live side by side.

## Risks & trade-offs (clear-eyed, not alarmist)

- **Centralization & freezing risk.** Corporate L1s and centrally issued stablecoins can **freeze or block addresses** under orders. That's essential for compliance, but it's also exclusion risk for high-friction jurisdictions. (You're trading censorship-resistance for predictability.) Safer for institutions, but some users can be switched off.
- **Liquidity bootstrapping.** Even with USDC as gas, **Arc** must win **market-makers, listings, and DeFi venues**; **Stripe's Tempo** is even earlier. Until liquidity is deep, the UX won't match the theory.
    
    Empty malls look great on paper.
    
- **Bridge and fragmentation risk.** Moving value across multiple chains creates attack surface. CCTP-style systems help, but operational risk doesn't vanish.
- **Policy chokepoints.** Real benefit requires **licensed on/off-ramps** in-country. Nigeria and Kenya are moving, but policy implementation matters more than headlines. Without legal doors in and out, the highway is a dead end.

## Who wins / who loses (by segment)

- **Enterprise fintechs & banks in Africa:** Win **if** they integrate early and pass savings to users; lose if they stall and let shadow channels own the rails. Move first, or play catch-up later.
- **L2s:** Lose some **payments settlement** over time **if** corporate L1s nail UX + compliance; still win on **DeFi/experimentation** and as **middleware** for other use cases. L2s won't die; they'll specialize.
- **Local infra (Blockradar, Paycrest, etc.):** Win by **abstracting Arc/Tempo** for local compliance and payouts. Lose if they try to compete with base-layer SDKs instead of complementing them.
    
    Be the plug, not the socket.
    
- **Users:** Win on **speed and (hopefully) cost**; risk **hard KYC gating** and **freezing** in edge cases. Faster and cheaper, inside a tighter rulebook.

## What to watch (so this doesn't devolve into vibes)

1. **Milestones:** Arc **public testnet** (fall 2025), mainnet beta (2026); any **named African partners** (banks, MTOs, PSPs). Official **Stripe/Tempo** confirmation.
    
    *Dates and logos, not vibes.*
    
2. **Benchmarks:** **World Bank RPW** for SSA corridors — we want sustained drops from **~8%** toward **&lt;5%**.
    
    *If fees don't drop, nothing changed.*
    
3. **Share shifts:** L2 **activity share** and **TVS** (L2BEAT), plus **stablecoin settlement share** by chain (Coin Metrics / Visa Onchain).
    
    *Follow the money, not the tweets.*

## 90-day action plan (operators & builders)

- **Pilot a corridor.** Pick one high-volume route (e.g., **NG↔UK**) and run a **sandbox**: stablecoin collection → FX → local payout. Measure **all-in cost** (including spread), **settlement time**, **reconciliation errors**.
    
    *Test a lane before rebuilding the highway.*
    
- **Abstract the base layer.** Whether it's **Arc** or an L2, build behind a **rail-agnostic** interface so you can swap infra as liquidity/fees change.
    
    *Don't hard-code a winner yet.*
    
- **Compliance first.** Align early with Nigeria's SEC posture and Kenya's VASP bill trajectory; secure **KYC/AML** processes and audit trails now.
    
    *Paperwork first, then scale. You know what happens if you do not do so, ask those before you.*
    
- **Merchant UX.** Don't ship "crypto." Ship **predictable receipts**, **chargeback policies**, **support SLAs**, and **Ledger-like** clarity on fees.
    
    *Sell outcomes, not chains.*

## Pushback corner, quick answers to big doubts

**"Will L2s die?"**

No. They'll likely lose *some* payments settlement if corporate L1s deliver, but L2s still dominate on throughput and remain fertile ground for apps and experiments. Less Visa, more App Store, as at today.

**"Isn't this just marketing?"**

Arc has concrete timelines and design choices (USDC gas, FX, EVM). Tempo is still a **reported** project; all of this as at press time, so treat it as speculative until Stripe goes on-record. Believe shipping code, not press.

**"Will this actually help Africa's costs?"**

Only if licensed partners enable **fiat legs** and FX spreads compress. The yardstick is the **World Bank RPW**. Tech helps, policy and partners decide.

**"What about cNGN?"**

It's real and progressing under a **sandbox/oversight** model; impact depends on acceptance and liquid FX paths with USD stables. Utility beats branding.

## Conclusion: track the metrics, not the memes

This isn't an obituary for L2s; it's a **re-segmentation** of the stack. If **payments giants** own the base layer for **stablecoin settlement**, some flows will consolidate where **fees, FX, and compliance** live natively. For Africa, that could mean **cheaper, faster**, more predictable rails — or just **new chokepoints** if execution and policy stall. The next 6–18 months will tell. I'll be watching **Arc's partner map**, **Tempo's confirmation**, **RPW costs**, and **where stablecoin settlement actually lands**. This can be a win, but only if pipes, partners, and policy line up.
