# MDX Features Showcase

This post demonstrates all the enhanced MDX features now available in our blog platform. You can use these components and styles in your own blog posts.

<TableOfContents />

## Heading with Auto-link

Hover over any heading to see the link icon. Click it to get a direct link to that section.

### Nested Headings Work Too

Even at level 3 and beyond.

## Styled Text Elements

Regular paragraphs have proper spacing and line height for better readability.

**Bold text** for emphasis, and *italic text* for subtle emphasis.

> Blockquotes are styled with a left border and subtle background.
> Perfect for quoting sources or highlighting important information.

## Lists

Unordered lists:

- Item one with proper spacing
- Item two with proper spacing
- Item three with proper spacing

Ordered lists:

1. First step
2. Second step
3. Third step

## Code Blocks with Syntax Highlighting

Inline code like `const example = "hello"` is styled for readability.

Code blocks with syntax highlighting and a copy button:

```javascript
// A simple React component
function Welcome({ name }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello, {name}</h1>
      <p>Welcome to our blog!</p>
    </div>
  );
}

// Usage
<Welcome name="Developer" />
```

```css
.blog-container {
  max-width: 800px;
  margin: 0 auto;
  padding: 2rem;
}

.heading {
  color: var(--primary);
  font-weight: 700;
}
```

## Custom Callout Components

<Callout>
  This is a default info callout.
</Callout>

<Callout type="tip" title="Pro Tip">
  This is a tip callout with a custom title.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
  This is a warning callout that alerts you to potential issues.
</Callout>

<Callout type="error" title="Critical Error">
  This is an error callout for critical information.
</Callout>
