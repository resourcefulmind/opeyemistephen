# Testing Metadata Edge Cases

This post doesn't focus on complex content structure but instead tests how our blog system handles various edge cases in frontmatter metadata.

## Metadata Fields Tested

This post tests the following types of edge cases:

1. **Extremely long values** - For titles, excerpts, tags, and other fields that might break layouts
2. **Special characters** - Including emojis, punctuation, and non-ASCII characters
3. **Empty and null values** - Testing how the system handles missing or empty data
4. **Unusual formatting** - Such as mixed case, extra whitespace, or unusual patterns
5. **Non-standard fields** - Testing how the system handles unexpected metadata
6. **ISO date formats** - Testing full ISO date format with time and timezone
7. **Nested objects** - Testing complex nested metadata objects

## Expected Behavior

The blog system should:

1. Properly validate and sanitize all metadata
2. Gracefully handle overly long content (truncate where appropriate)
3. Correctly display or escape special characters
4. Use default values for missing/null/empty fields when appropriate
5. Ignore unrecognized fields
6. Parse dates correctly
7. Handle nested objects appropriately

## Testing Notes

When rendering this post, check that:

- The UI doesn't break with the extremely long title
- Tags are displayed properly, even extremely long ones
- Author information is displayed correctly
- Date formatting is consistent
- All special characters render properly
- The system doesn't crash on unexpected fields

This post has intentionally minimal content because its primary purpose is to test metadata handling.
